# Iris Flower Machine Leraning Project

* * *

This is a decent dataset for my first project because it is so well understood.
This is true because of these reasons:
* All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale.
* It is a simple multi-class classification problem
* It is a classification problem, which is an easier type of supervised learning algorithm
* This dataset only contains 4 columns and 150 rows, which is small and efficient

* This is considered the "Hello World" of Machine Learning
* Using a structured step-by-step process any predictive modeling machine learning can be broken into 4 stages:
	* 1. Collect Data
	* 2. Pick the Model
	* 3. Train the Model
	* 4. Test the Model
	
* For this project, I train a simple classifier on the Iris Dataset, which comes with scikit-learning
* The dataset includes four features of flowers:
	* 1. Sepal Length
	* 2. Sepal Width
	* 3. Petal Length
	* 4. Petal Width
	
* With these features, it classifies them into three flower species (in this case, labels): Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
* The labels have been represented as numbers in the dataset:
	* 0 = Setosa
	* 1 = Versicolor
	* 2 = Virginica
* I rearrange the Iris dataset, then partition it into separate training and testing sets; keeping the last 10 data points for testing and rest for training.
